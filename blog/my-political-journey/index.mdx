Politics and the fight against injustice have always been part of my life.

I learned about politics early in my life from my parents. I never knew either of my  grandfathers, one a political prisoner who was tortured to death in prison by the new communist regime in Romania; the other a Welsh boy who gave up his place at a grammar school to go and work to support his family in the desperately poor mining community where they lived. These men, who had no power or privilege, still managed to lead honourable and principled lives.

As we travelled the world in the 1970s, my father supported us by working for the BBC World Service, and he reported on stories in the islands we visited in the Caribbean and Pacific that taught me at a young age about the injustice of slavery, empire and imperialism. At the age of 9 and 10 I was reading Alex Haley's Roots, learning about the horrors of slavery, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich about the repression of communist regimes.

Injustice and intolerance were all around me, and yet in so many remote places the poorest communities gave us the richest welcome. Yet when we came home, trying to settle into school in Thatcher’s Britain was tough, I was bullied and called all sorts of racist names. I remembered those children I’d made friends with far away who just accepted me. It left me with a deep belief in tolerance, even more so today as we see so much intolerance and hatred of people who are different.
